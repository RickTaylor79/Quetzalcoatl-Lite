# Install

1. Download the plugin and factory content (Quetzalcoatl_0_1_0_Samples.hr1) from the ![releases page](https://github.com/publicsamples/Quetzalcoatl/releases).
2. Copy Quetzalcoatl.component to Library/Audio/Plugins/Components/
3. Wait for any additional files to download
4. Start your DAW. You'll probably get a message saying “the developer cannot be verified” to fix this open System Preferences → Security and Privacy. On the general tab click ‘Open anyway’.
5. On loading Quetzalcoatl you will be asked for the factory content file you downloaded earlier. Open this and the restart the plugin.
6. You should now be ready to use the plugin. If you wish to install any of the additional sample packs, click on the "Load expansion" button and select the file (as with the factory content, you'll need to restart the plugin for hte content to appear).

Or something like that anyway, if you have any problems just get in touch.
